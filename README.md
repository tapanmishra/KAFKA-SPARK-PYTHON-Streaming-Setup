# KAFKA-SPARK-PYTHON-Streaming-Setup

When we try to set up an environment locally for dabble with stream/event driven programming, its often extremely difficult to set an working one. While we have seen the use of docker extensively, but, as an programmer it often gives clarity to us when we set the environment about the various possiblities ans the structure of the entire set up. This clarity is gold for programmar. In this repository i am going to set up a kafka, apache spark based python set up to create a local environment on WINDOWS machine. There are plenty of examples available for Ubuntu or MAC OS based setup. But all the windows one are either old or partial.

# Planing of environment

I want to use the following software
1. Apache Kafka
2. Apache Spark
3. PySpark
4. Python 
However knowing what we want is half the problem solved. The most important thing is determining the compatibility. I personally lost 3 nights of sleep figuring out the compatible versions.If we dont use the right versions, it will not work finally and that is the most critical part.
